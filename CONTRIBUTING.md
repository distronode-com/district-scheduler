# Contributing to Calnode

Thanks for considering a contribution! This guide covers getting the app building,
running, and tested locally. For *how the system fits together*, read
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) first — it's the map.

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.26+** (the binary is pure-Go SQLite — no CGO, no C toolchain needed)
- **Node 20+** and **pnpm** (the admin UI is SvelteKit; we use `pnpm`, not npm)

## Layout

- `cmd/calnode/` — entry point + CLI tools (key recovery/rotation, admin reset)
- `internal/` — the backend (handlers, booking engine, calendar providers, slots,
  mailer, worker, crypto, db). This is where most changes live.
- `frontend/` — the SvelteKit admin SPA, embedded into the Go binary at compile time
- `internal/handler/templates/*.html` — the public, server-rendered booking pages
  (separate from the Svelte app — see ARCHITECTURE §2)
- `internal/db/migrations/` — goose SQL migrations, run automatically on startup

## Build

The frontend is embedded into the binary via `go:embed`, so a build is two steps —
the `Makefile` chains them:

```bash
make build      # pnpm build in frontend/, then go build -o calnode ./cmd/calnode
```

> **Gotcha:** restarting the Go server alone won't pick up frontend changes — the
> assets are baked in at compile time. After editing anything under `frontend/`,
> re-run `make build` (or `pnpm build` then rebuild Go).

## Run locally

Minimum env to boot (a dev box can omit the encryption key — see the caveat below):

```bash
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
DATABASE_URL=sqlite://./data/calnode.db \
./calnode
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` → it redirects to `/admin/` and walks first-run setup
(create the owner, optionally connect a calendar, add an event type). Full env-var
reference and integration setup (Google/Microsoft OAuth, SMTP, Litestream) live in
[DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

> Without `CALNODE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` on a non-https `BASE_URL`, the vault uses an
> ephemeral per-process key, so encrypted data (OAuth tokens, SMTP password) won't
> survive a restart — fine for local dev. Production (https) hard-fails without it.

## Tests

```bash
go test ./...                       # backend — keep these green
cd frontend && pnpm test:visual     # real-browser computed-style checks
```

**Run `pnpm test:visual` after touching** `frontend/src/lib/components/ui/**`,
`frontend/src/app.css`, or the theme. shadcn-svelte styles state via Tailwind
`data-*` variants that need `@custom-variant` remaps in `app.css`; miss one and the
component renders **silently unstyled** (logic works, visuals don't). Unit tests
don't catch this class of bug — only the browser assertions do. See
`frontend/TESTING.md`.

## Migrations

Add a goose SQL file in `internal/db/migrations/` with the next number
(`000NN_short_name.sql`, `-- +goose Up` / `-- +goose Down`). They run on startup.
SQLite can't easily drop columns, so `ADD COLUMN` is reversible-by-convention only —
prefer additive, nullable/defaulted columns.

## Translations

Calnode ships 9 locales (`en es fr fr-CA de it pt nl sv`) across the booker-facing surfaces:
booking page, manage/reschedule page, embed widget, the four emails, and the calendar
invite. The admin UI and the built-in video room are English-only.

**Translation PRs are very welcome** - both new languages and corrections to existing
ones. **Every non-English locale is currently a machine draft with no native review**, so
if you speak one of them, fixes are genuinely valuable and will be merged readily. Small,
single-language PRs are easier to review than sweeping ones.

**Adding a language is adding one file:** `internal/i18n/locales/<code>.json`. No Go,
template, or frontend change is needed - `init()` globs the directory, and the language
switcher, the fallback-language setting and the public API payload all read
`SupportedLocales()`.

1. Copy `internal/i18n/locales/en.json` and translate the values. Keep every key, keep
   the key order (it keeps diffs readable), and keep printf verbs (`%s`, `%d`, `%q`)
   intact - reordering them is fine with indexed verbs (`%[2]s`), dropping them is not.
2. Name the file **BCP-47 canonical**: `pt-BR.json`, never `pt-br.json`.
3. `dow_short_*`, `month_short_*`, `date_format` and `clock_format` are data, not code -
   Go has no locale date tables. Match CLDR; the test below checks you against `Intl`.
4. Run `go test ./internal/i18n/`. Three guards will tell you exactly what is wrong:
   key parity, printf-verb parity (with `fmt` as the oracle), and a CLDR cross-check of
   the date tables (needs `node` on PATH; skipped if absent).
5. Eyeball the result: `go run ./cmd/calnode`, then
   `http://localhost:3000/book/<slug>?lang=<code>` and the manage page. Long words
   overflowing buttons is the usual surprise; check mobile width too.

Background and the full list of limitations (2-form plurals, no RTL) are in
[ARCHITECTURE.md §23](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Conventions

- **`gofmt`** all Go; standard library style. The codebase favours small, clear
  functions with comments that explain *why*, not *what*.
- **`pnpm` only**, and `pnpm exec <tool>` for local binaries (`pnpm dlx` has a
  Windows manifest bug).
- **Read [ARCHITECTURE.md §17](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** (cross-cutting gotchas) before
  editing — especially the SQLite single-connection rule (never query inside an open
  cursor), all-times-UTC, and "calendar side effects are best-effort."
- **Keep the docs honest.** If your change alters behaviour described in
  ARCHITECTURE.md, update the matching section in the same PR.

## Pull requests

1. Branch off `main`.
2. `go test ./...` green; `make build` succeeds; run `pnpm test:visual` if you
   touched UI/theme.
3. Keep the change focused; explain the *why* in the PR description.
4. **No contributor licence agreement here.** Contributions to this fork are accepted
   under [Apache-2.0](LICENSE) section 5, which is to say under the licence the file you
   are editing already carries. There is nothing to sign and no bot will comment. If your
   change is one we forward to upstream Calnode, upstream's own CLA applies to it there,
   and we will say so on the pull request before sending it.

The distributed code remains [Apache-2.0](LICENSE). "Calnode" is upstream's project
name and mark — see [TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md) for how you may (and may not) use it,
